<!-- new content section -->
    <section class=header>
    <p>The SGG packages includes a site, ready for deployment, but a production setup can separate the <em>program package</em>, the <em>theme</em> and the <em>content</em>; the path to these folders can be changed with <code>settings2.yaml</code> file in the site directory when starting the <code>serversg</code>, <code>serverbake</code> and the <code>ssg10</code> program.</p>
    <h2 id="site-directory">Site directory</h2>
    <p>The site directory is the directory in which the <code>settings2.yaml</code> file is located. It is usual to have "dough" (i.e. the content) in subdirectories of the site directory, but other locations can be selected (in <code>settings2.yaml</code>).</p>
    <h2 id="theme-folder">theme folder</h2>
    <p>All the material to fix the appearance of a site are collected here. The content is relatively independent from the settings in the theme. The theme includes the templates which are eventually filled with content; the labels which determine where content must be injected must correspond to the tags for the pieces of content (see <a href="TransformationOfPost.html">How a content is transformed</a></p>
    <h2 id="main-menu">Main Menu</h2>
    <p>The menu structure is in the settings2.yaml file as a YAML structure, with link and text fields. Links contain relative links to the index.html files in the folders, the visible explanations.</p>
    <h2 id="the-dough-in-the-site-folder">the dough (in the site folder)</h2>
    <p>The dough is the content which is baked (or shaked) into the static site.</p>
    <h3 id="landing-page">Landing page</h3>
    <p>The <code>landingPage.md</code> in the site folder is the text for the title page of the site; other pages are in directories (one level only ??).</p>
    <p>The landing page typically contains a general introduction and links to the major pieces - possibly with some explanation.</p>
    <h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
    <p>The <code>resources</code> folder in the dough directory contains all supporting data which is used in with a markdown text (e.g. images, BibTex files) must go into the same folder than the markdown; this makes relative references possible. Relative references are just the filename of the resource and are interpreted relative to the current page.</p>
    <p>Question: should resources which must be copied to static and resources which are only used during text preparation be separated?</p>
    <h2 id="the-baked-folder-the-html-files-served">the baked folder (the html files served)</h2>
    <p>The baked folder includes the static site with an index ready to be served; it has the same file structure as <code>dough</code>, except that all static files (from theme and dough) go to a <code>static</code> folder and are served with <code>//site-url/static/filename</code></p>
    <h2 id="code">code</h2>
    <p>The code is in three directories: src, test and Lib. Additionally there are files</p>
    <ul>
    <li>SSG.cabal</li>
    <li>stack.yaml</li>
    <li>LICENSE</li>
    </ul>
    </section>


        <p class=tiny>
        Produced with SGG 0.0.1 on somestring to avoid failures in regression test from "SSGdesign/DefaultFileLayout.md".
