  abstract  = {The article presents a conceptual framework for computations with imprecise values. Typically, the treatment of imprecise values differs from the treatment of precise values. While precise computations use a single number to characterize a value, computations with imprecise values must deal with several numbers for each value. This results in significant changes in the program code because values are represented, e.g., by expectation and standard deviation and both values must be considered within the computations. It would be desirable to have a solution where only limited changes in very specific places of the code are necessary. The mathematical concept of lifting may lead to such a solution.},

  abstract  = {A central task of a multidisciplinary projects is to explain and declare the concepts and
connections of concepts of all the different disciplines and participants involved. Ontologies
and their tools can clarify and interpret the differences between words in context of
multidisciplinary users even though in a customary familiar context such words appear to
have the same meaning.
Ontologies are formal descriptions of concepts that are useful to achieve sharing of
computerized files. Ontologies describe things and operations that can be applied to them.
They improve communication between people, especially if they communicate indirectly
by sharing computerized databases, through organized concepts used to encode the
perception of reality in computer representations. The configuration of the central
database in which results of disciplines are allocated in a reusable way follows from
the formal ontology.
The presented tiered ontology distinguishes between simple observations, physical
objects that the observer conceptualizes, and the socially constructed objects of social reality.
Operations connect between different concepts in a traceable way.
A tiered ontology contributes to the separation of observation of physical facts from their
interpretation; they are thus important in multi-disciplinary and multi-language research
teams. A formal ontology translates to a tool to help the archaeologist to record his
observations in a form later reusable and integrable with the results from others!},
